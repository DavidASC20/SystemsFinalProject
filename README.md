By Flora Au, David Chong, and Kirsten Szeto -- PD 5
Risk is a complex board game produced by Hasbro that involves both luck and skill. The goal is simple: take over the world.  (Taken from Google)

We are creating a turn-based strategy game that involves raising troops and capturing territory.  

Currently, there are 3 different parts of the game.

<ul>
  <il>Amassing Troops</il>
  <il>Fighting</il>
  <il>Fortifying</il>
</ul>
